\frametitle{Guiding Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does one's social identity influence their demands for representation?
	\item How does knowledge of the district's constituency characteristics influence one's demands for government responsiveness? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Past Research}
\begin{itemize}
	\item People demand representatives to represent them based on the most salient aspects of their personal identities
	\item Not many are as politically sophisticated to understand how politicians prioritize representation
	\item Citizens may not be as knowledgeable about national politics, but they know what people in their inner circle desire from the national government
	\item Collective v. Dyadic representation - Legislator like me rather than a legislator like my country
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \tb{\e{Egocentric Hypothesis:}} As a representative's effort on behalf of groups with which the citizen identifies increases, the citizen's evaluation of the representative will become more positive. 
	\item \tb{\e{Proportionality Hypothesis:}} Citizens will expect that representatives expend effort on behalf of groups in proportion to their role in the constituency.
	\item \tb{\e{Heterogeneity Information Hypothesis:}} The link between representative effort, citizen identity and citizen evaluations will be attenuated by information about the heterogeneity of one’s constituency and strengthened by information about the homogeneity of one’s constituency. 
	\item \tb{\e{Size Information Hypothesis:}} The link between representative effort, citizen identity and citizen evaluations will be attenuated by information that the identity group is a small part of the constituency and strengthened by information that the identity group is a large part of the constituency.

	*Partisan gap indicates the difference between Republicans and Democrats’ propensity to identify with the group. A score of 1.0 would indicate all Republicans very closely identify with the group and all Democrats do not feel close to the group, while a -1.0 would indicate the opposite.

	Based on the information provided, your member of Congress is Mike Turner, a member of the Republican Party. He has served in Congress since 2003. The Third District of Ohio is a largely urban district which is dominated by the city of Dayton; more than three-quarters of its population resides within Montgomery County. The district is heavily Republican: it has supported Republican presidential candidates in the last three elections, and Turner has not faced a competitive election since being elected to Congress. The district is also racially homogeneous: whites make up more than 80\% of the district’s residents, and this number rises to over 90\% outside of Dayton proper.&Based on the information provided, your member of Congress is Mike Turner, a member of the Republican Party. He has served in Congress since 2003. The Third District of Ohio stretches across large sections of southwestern Ohio, from the city of Dayton to rural counties east of Cincinnati. Although Dayton is the largest city in the district, a majority of its residents live in the Cincinnati media market. The district leans Republican in presidential and Congressional elections, but had a history of electing Democrats to Congress throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and the city of Dayton provides a strong based of Democratic support. The district ranks as one of the most racially diverse in the state of Ohio, with the city of Dayton almost evenly split between black and white residents.\\

\frametitle{Analysis and Results}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item \tb{Analysis:} Ordered logit models and accounted for errors in individual differences
	\item \tb{Model 1:} Personal attachment to group leads to higher demands for representation (23\%) than group preceived group influence (9\%)
	\item \tb{Model 2:} Framing of district homogeneity does not alter demands for representation - If anything, reminders of district composition leads some respondents to think MCs should not cater to some groups
	\item \tb{Model 3:} Closeness to group and preceived group influence are not influenced by information related to the distribution of the district
	\item \tb{Model 4:} Participants are more likely to support representation for groups and parties that they identify, and this is not influenced by the distribution of interests in their district
